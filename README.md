# MenuBuilder

A program that helps the programer create a menu on console for any type of program he may choose to build, meaning the programmer can use this software to create a menu for his 
specific needs that will suit him and his functions and applications.

the system uses 2 different methods to create this universal program.

1) it uses delegates and event handlers to create the menu.
2)it uses an interface to create the menu.

the programmer needs only chose in which one of said methods to create his menu and assign his functions and applications to his menu\submenu.
in this current repository is a test showing how it is built and used on  date\time functions as well as a space counter functionality.

this project was given as an assignment in C# using the .NET frameworks in the course : C# and .NET framework for windowed applications in MTA.
